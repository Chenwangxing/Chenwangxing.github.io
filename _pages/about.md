Hi, I’m Wangxing Chen! I’m currently a final-year PhD student at [Shenyang University of Technology]([https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io](https://www.sut.edu.cn/)).

My research is focused on pedestrian trajectory prediction, intelligent transportation, and robot navigation.

My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Measurement and Control Technology and Instrumentation from Shenyang University of Technology, which I received in 2020. In 2020, I continued my studies at Shenyang University of Technology to pursue a Master's degree in Instrument Science and Technology, and subsequently pursued a Doctoral degree in Instrument Science and Technology through a combined Master's and Doctoral program.
